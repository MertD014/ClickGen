# ClickGen
Auto Clicker Software for Minecraft mainly ^^

How to use?

1. Open the .jar file.
2. Enter a delay and press set delay.
3. Enter your hotkey and press set hotkey.
4. Now you can start the clicking by the start/stop button or your hotkey.

Please share your feedback with me. I would like to make ClickGen the auto clicking app.
