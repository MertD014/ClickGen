# ClickGen
Auto Clicker Software for Minecraft mainly ^^

How to use?
Open the .jar file.
Enter a delay and press set delay.
Enter your hotkey and press set hotkey.
Now you can start the clicking by the start/stop button or your hotkey.

Please share your feedback with me. I would like to make ClickGen the auto clicking app.
